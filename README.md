Overview
This project uses state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection. The core task of the project is to identify and classify objects in images and videos, along with providing bounding boxes around detected objects. It leverages pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN, which are fine-tuned for a specific dataset.

Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model)
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL
(Optional) CUDA and cuDNN for GPU support
You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/RitikRaj0105/object-detection.git
cd object-detection
Usage
1. Detect Objects in a Single Image:
You can run object detection on a single image using the following command:

bash
Copy
python detect.py --image /path/to/image.jpg --output /path/to/output.jpg
2. Detect Objects in a Video:
For object detection in videos, use this command:

bash
Copy
python detect_video.py --video /path/to/video.mp4 --output /path/to/output_video.mp4
3. Real-time Object Detection (Webcam):
To run real-time object detection using your webcam:

bash
Copy
python detect_realtime.py
Dataset
The model is trained using publicly available datasets like COCO, VOC, or a custom dataset. If you want to train the model on your own dataset, ensure that it follows the correct format for annotations (e.g., XML for VOC or JSON for COCO).

To use a custom dataset, update the dataset paths and annotation files in the configuration file.

Model Training
1. Prepare Your Dataset:
Ensure your dataset is properly labeled and split into training and validation sets. Use annotation tools like LabelImg or VIA to label objects in images.

2. Training the Model:
To start training the object detection model, run:


python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch-size 32
Adjust the --epochs and --batch-size parameters based on your hardware capabilities.

3. Evaluate the Model:
After training, evaluate the model's performance using:


python evaluate.py --model /path/to/model.h5 --dataset /path/to/validation_dataset
Results
After training, the model's performance can be evaluated on a test set. You can visualize the results on test images, including the accuracy and the precision-recall curve.

Example output for detected objects in an image:

Class 1: Car (confidence: 92%)
Class 2: Dog (confidence: 89%)
